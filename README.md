Tutorial Repository
I a student at Coder Camps in Scottsdale, AZ.
I am currently enrolled in their 12-week immersive JavaScript/React Bootcamp.
As of 7/15/2017, I have just completed my 4th week of instruction.
So far we have learned all about the backend foundations and we are preparing to embark on learning React/Redux in the next week!
I am spending this weekend learning as much as I can about Git and Github and am creating this repo for practice.
